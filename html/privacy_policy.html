                            This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the servers of the hosting

                            the user’s device (e.g. device fingerprinting). Consent may be revoked at any time.
                            Our hosting provider will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill its obligations and follow our

                            Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will be stored
                            until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you request deletion or revoke your consent, your data will
                            be deleted unless legally required reasons (e.g. tax or commercial retention periods) justify further storage.
